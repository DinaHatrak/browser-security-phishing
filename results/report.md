# Final Project Report

## Introduction
This project investigates the role of browser security indicators in shaping user trust and their exploitation in phishing attacks. The study combines technical aspects of cybersecurity with psychological insights into human behavior.

## Methodology
- **Technical Component:** Development of demo pages (secure.html and phish.html) to illustrate how indicators appear in practice.
- **Literature Review:** Analysis of academic studies on browser indicators, phishing techniques, and digital trust.
- **Psychological Perspective:** Examination of how users interpret visual cues such as the padlock icon and HTTPS.

## Results
- Browser indicators alone are insufficient to guarantee safety.
- Attackers can exploit valid SSL certificates to deceive users.
- Users often rely on superficial signals, leading to misplaced trust.

## Conclusion
Effective defense against phishing requires a dual approach:
1. Stronger technical measures (improved browser warnings, certificate validation).
2. Enhanced user education (training to critically evaluate websites).
