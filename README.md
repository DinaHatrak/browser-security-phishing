A study on browser security indicators and phishing attacks combining cybersecurity and psychology.

## The Illusion of Trust: Browser Security Indicators and Human Psychology in Phishing Attacks

### Introduction
This project explores how browser security indicators (such as the padlock icon and HTTPS) can create an illusion of trust for users, and how attackers exploit this illusion in phishing attacks. The goal is to combine the technical perspective (security protocols and browser mechanisms) with the behavioral perspective (human psychology and trust in digital environments).

### Objectives
- Analyze the effectiveness of browser security indicators.
- Study how attackers leverage these indicators in phishing campaigns.
- Connect cybersecurity with cognitive psychology to understand user behavior.
- Propose technical and educational solutions to reduce phishing risks.

### Project Structure
- docs/ : Documentation (literature review, theoretical background).
- src/ : Experimental web pages (secure vs. phishing prototypes).
- data/ : Mock datasets or notes.
- analysis/ : Data analysis scripts or notebooks.
- results/ : Final reports and visualizations.

### Practical Component
Demo Pages:
- Secure page: src/secure.html
- Phishing page: src/phish.html

These demo pages illustrate how browser indicators can influence user trust. They are simple prototypes designed to show the difference between a legitimate secure page and a deceptive phishing page.

### Expected Results
- Browser indicators alone are insufficient to guarantee user safety.
- Attackers can exploit misplaced trust in these indicators.
- Effective defense requires both stronger technical measures and user awareness training.

- Academic studies on browser security indicators.
- Research in cognitive psychology and digital trust.
- Real-world phishing case studies.
