# Literature Review

## Browser Security Indicators
Several academic studies have examined the effectiveness of browser security indicators. Research shows that while users notice the padlock icon and HTTPS, many do not fully understand their meaning. Studies highlight that these indicators often create a false sense of security.

## Phishing and SSL Certificates
Scholars have documented how attackers increasingly use valid SSL certificates to make phishing sites appear legitimate. This trend demonstrates that technical signals alone are insufficient to protect users.

## Psychology of Trust in Digital Environments
Psychological research emphasizes that users rely on visual cues and simple heuristics when making trust decisions online. The presence of a padlock icon can strongly influence user perception, even when other warning signs are present.

## Interdisciplinary Findings
The literature suggests that effective defense against phishing requires both technical improvements (stronger browser warnings, certificate validation) and educational measures (training users to critically evaluate websites).
