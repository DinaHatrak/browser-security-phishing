# Theoretical Background

## Browser Security Indicators
Modern web browsers use visual indicators such as the padlock icon and the "https://" prefix to signal secure connections. These indicators are based on SSL/TLS protocols, which ensure encryption and authentication between client and server. While technically accurate, these signals can be misleading if users assume they guarantee overall safety.

## Phishing Attacks
Phishing is a social engineering technique where attackers create deceptive websites or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Attackers often exploit browser indicators by using valid SSL certificates, making their sites appear trustworthy despite malicious intent.

## Human Psychology and Trust
From a psychological perspective, users rely heavily on visual cues and heuristics when browsing. The padlock icon or "https://" can trigger a sense of trust, even if users do not fully understand the underlying technology. This phenomenon is known as the "illusion of trust," where confidence is misplaced due to superficial signals.

## Interdisciplinary Connection
By combining cybersecurity (technical mechanisms) with cognitive psychology (human behavior), we can better understand why users fall victim to phishing despite security measures. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the need for both stronger technical defenses and improved user education.
