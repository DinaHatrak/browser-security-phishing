# Design Documentation

## Secure Page (secure.html)
The secure page is designed to simulate a legitimate website. It uses HTTPS and displays a padlock icon in the browser. The page includes simple content such as a welcome message and a login form. The goal is to demonstrate how security indicators appear in a genuine environment.

## Phishing Page (phish.html)
The phishing page is designed to mimic a legitimate site but with deceptive intent. It also uses HTTPS and displays a padlock icon, but the content is crafted to trick users into entering sensitive information. The page may include a fake login form or misleading text. The goal is to show how attackers exploit browser indicators to create an illusion of trust.

## Visual Differences
While both pages use HTTPS and appear secure, subtle differences exist:
- The secure page emphasizes clarity and transparency.
- The phishing page uses misleading cues to manipulate user behavior.

## Purpose of Design
The design of these demo pages highlights the gap between technical signals (SSL/TLS indicators) and user perception. By comparing the two, users can understand how trust can be misplaced and why additional awareness is necessary.
